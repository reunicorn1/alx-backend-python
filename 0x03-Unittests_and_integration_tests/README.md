# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

Unittests and Integration Tests are two types of testing methodologies used in software development.
Unittests are used to verify the correctness of a unit of code, which could be a function or a method. They are typically written and maintained by the developers who write the code, and are intended to be simple, quick to write, and quick to run.
Integration Tests, on the other hand, are used to test the interaction between different parts of a system, such as two or more units of code working together, or a piece of code interacting with a database or network. These tests are typically more complex and take longer to run than unittests.
Both types of tests are important for ensuring the quality and reliability of software. Unittests help catch issues early in the development process, while Integration Tests help catch issues that only appear when different parts of the system are working together.
