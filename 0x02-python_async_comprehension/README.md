# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

Async comprehension is a concept in Python that allows you to create asynchronous list comprehensions. It's a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and concise manner. It's similar to regular list comprehension but it's used with async functions which return a coroutine object. This can be useful when you have a list of tasks that can be executed concurrently, rather than sequentially.
